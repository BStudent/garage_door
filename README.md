# Basic Garage Door Hacking
This is the project demonstrated at the 2022 Arsenal
Lab at Black Hat Las Vegas.

## Overview
After cloning the project, cd into the newly created
garage_door directory, then open gnuradio-companion 
there.

You can then proceed through each project in order until
reaching the final project.

The final project will not be in gnuradio-companion
but will be run in Python from the command line.

Please see Instructions.pdf for more detailed instructions.
